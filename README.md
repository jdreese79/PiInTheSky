# Pi In The Sky

## Planning

### Goal
Our assignment is to somehow get a Pi in the air (whether it be thrown, shot, etc.) and do two things: collect acceleration data of the whole flight and signal when it thinks it's at the apex of its flight. We have to make some sort of enclosure to hold all of the components in place. 

### Resources and Constraints
Resources: 3D printer, laser cutter, soldering set, hand tools
Constraints: time and materials (we can't use too much material and we are not limetless in our resources)

### Solution
We want to create an enclosure shaped like a slice of pie for our pi (and all of its related components for this project) to be shot out of a sling shot that we will also make. 

### Materials
- Raspberry Pi Zero
- Lithium Battery
- Accelerometer
- PowerBoost 500 Charger
- LED (to signal top of flight)
- acrylic/laser cutter
- 3D printer
- styrofoam

### Process



### Schedule

February 1st- Finish Planning (completed)

February 8th- solidworks design almost complete (completed)

February 15th- solidworks design complete and ready to get printed out (completed)

February 22nd- solidworks parts printed out 

March 1st- components wired/ soldering finished (completed)

March 8th- styrofoam cut out/ progress on the code (make sure all part are correctly wired)

March 15th- slingshot in progress

March 22nd- wood parts for slingshot cut/ get accelerometer to work at startup and save all data 

March 29th- slingshot finalized/ figure out how to make LED turn on at apex

April 12th- progress on code

April 19th- progress on code... however long this takes (final step for code: make it headless/ starts on its own at startup)


### Timeline

2/4/19- Today we began assembling the components on solidworks. We mated a header to the pi and worked on making a bonnet to use for the solidowrks design.

2/6/19- We continued working on the solidworks design and began working on the fritzing.

2/7/19- Finished the fritzing diagram and uploaded it to github. Continued working on the solidworks design while waiting for the bonnet to come.

2/8/19- We continued working on the solidworks design because the bonnet still hasn't come in yet.

2/15/19- Today we lasercut the acrylic base for the raspberry pi.

2/21/19- The bonnet came in and we soldered a header to it for the raspberry pi to connect to. Next class we will solder the remaining headers and wires.

2/22/19- Today we finishd the soldering.

2/25/19- We 3D printed the brackets that will hold the battery in place. We also planned out how we're going to make the slingshot and the pie slice.

2/27/19- Today we finishing the wiring and started working on the styrofoam pie slice.

2/28/19- We finished cutting out all of the layers of the pie slice.

3/1/19- Today we glued together all of the styrofoam layers.

3/6/19- We decided to use our styrofoam model as a prototype and then rebuiltthe pie slice using more durable material. We used a more precise way of cutting the layers to create a cleaner shape.

3/7/19- Today we glued the layers together and cut a rectangle out of the center. Finally we cutt a small circle out of the top layer to fit the LED mount inside (to act as a cherry on a piece of pie).
