# Pi In The Sky

## Planning

### Goal
Our assignment is to somehow get a Pi in the air (whether it be thrown, shot, etc.) and do two things: collect acceleration data of the whole flight and signal when it thinks it's at the apex of its flight. We have to make some sort of enclosure to hold all of the components in place. 

### Resources and Constraints
Resources: 3D printer, laser cutter, soldering set, hand tools
Constraints: time and materials (we can't use too much material and we are not limetless in our resources)

### Solution
We want to create a disk-shaped enclosure for our pi (and all of its related components for this project) to be shot out of a sling shot that we will also make.
